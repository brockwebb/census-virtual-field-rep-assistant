# Census Burro: Evaluation Framework

## Purpose & Scope

This document establishes the evaluation methodology for the Census Burro virtual assistant, defining criteria, methods, and quality assurance procedures to ensure reliable and safe responses to Field Representative queries. The framework is designed for iterative implementation, starting with human-validated baselines and evolving toward automated quality assurance at production scale.

## Evaluation Methods

### Phase 1: Human Baseline Establishment

#### **SME Review Process**
1. **Reviewer Calibration:** All SMEs review identical test set to establish consistency
2. **Independent Scoring:** Each question scored by minimum 2 SMEs
3. **Consensus Building:** Disagreements resolved through discussion and documentation
4. **Gold Standard Creation:** Agreed-upon responses become baseline truth set

#### **Inter-rater Reliability Threshold**
- **Target Agreement:** 85% within 10 points on 100-point scale
- **Conflict Resolution:** Third SME review for scores >15 points apart
- **Calibration Frequency:** Monthly re-calibration sessions

#### **Review Coverage (Phase 1)**
- **100% human review** of all system responses
- **Minimum 3 questions per category/complexity combination**
- **Documentation of rationale** for all scoring decisions

### Phase 2: Risk-Stratified Sampling

#### **Sampling Strategy**
```
Critical Risk: 100% human review
High Risk: 50% random sample + 100% of flagged responses
Medium Risk: 20% random sample + targeted review
Low Risk: 5% spot check + anomaly detection
```

#### **Automated Pre-screening**
- **Keyword Detection:** Flag responses containing safety-critical terms
- **Confidence Scoring:** Review low-confidence responses
- **Source Attribution:** Verify all citations are accurate
- **Length Anomalies:** Review unusually short/long responses

### Phase 3: Ensemble Evaluation

#### **Multi-LLM Validation**
- **Primary Evaluator:** GPT-4 fine-tuned on SME scoring patterns
- **Secondary Evaluator:** Claude/other model for consensus
- **Conflict Resolution:** Human review when evaluators disagree
- **Continuous Learning:** Update evaluator models based on human feedback
