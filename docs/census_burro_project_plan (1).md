# Census Burro: AI-Powered Field Representative Support System

## Executive Summary / Elevator Pitch

**The Challenge:** 4,000+ Census Bureau Field Representatives (FRs) need instant access to complex procedural knowledge while working in the field. Currently, they rely on Field Supervisors, email chains, and phone calls for critical information, creating delays, inconsistencies, and overwhelming backend subject matter experts.

**The Solution:** Census Burro - an AI-powered chatbot that wraps a natural language interface around all Census documentation. Field Representatives can ask questions in plain English and receive accurate, contextual answers instantly, whether they're dealing with hostile residents, gated communities, equipment issues, or procedural questions. Industry research indicates that chatbots can handle 80% of routine questions while providing responses 80% faster than human agents (Connell, 2025).

**The Impact:** 
- **Significant reduction** in supervisor calls and emails (industry studies show 30-70% reduction in support requests) (Master of Code Global, 2025; Indigo.ai, 2025; Wonderchat, 2025)
- **Instant access** to institutional knowledge 24/7
- **Consistent answers** across all field operations
- **Improved FR safety** through immediate access to safety protocols
- **Scalable support** that grows with workforce surges (including decennial operations)

**The Innovation:** Rigorous evaluation framework with automated testing ensures reliability and continuous improvement as the system evolves.
